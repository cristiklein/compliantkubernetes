## Compliant Kubernetes Cryptography Dashboard

![Cryptography Dashboard](img/cryptography.png)

The Compliant Kubernetes Cryptography Dashboard allows to quickly audit the status of cryptography. It shows, amongst others, the public Internet endpoints (Ingresses) that are encrypted and the expiry time. Default Compliant Kubernetes configurations automatically renew certificates before expiry.

## Handling Non-Compliance

In case there is a violation of cryptography policies:

* If a certificate is expired and was not renewed, ask the administrator to check the status of `cert-manager` and `ingress-controller` component.
* If an endpoint is not encrypted, ask the developers to set the necessary [Ingress annotations](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/).
