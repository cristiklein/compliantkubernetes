## Compliant Kubernetes Backup Dashboard

![Backup Dashboard](img/backup.png)

The Compliant Kubernetes Backup Dashboard allows to quickly audit the status of backups and ensure the [Recovery Point Objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective) are met.

## Handling Non-Compliance

In case there is a violation of backup policies:

* Ask the administrator to check the status of the [backup jobs](../operator-manual/disaster-recovery.md).
* Ask the developers to check if they correctly marked Kubernetes resources with the necessary [backup annotations](../user-guide/backup.md).
